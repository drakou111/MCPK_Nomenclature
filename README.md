# MCPK_Nomenclature
Minecraft Parkour Nomenclature, about how to define jumps, strategies and setups.

Notes: 
+ This is for JAVA 1.8.9.
+ [] will refer to any number. For example, "[]t" would be  "1t", "-19t", "4t", etc. 
+ [] can also contain a range, like [1..6] which would mean any number between 1 (inclusive) and 6 (inclusive).
+ {} refers to any block. For example, "{} to {}" could be "slab to fence" or "s to f".
+ Every use of "?" means that this is not commonly used.
+ Every use of "(by default)" means that its assumed that it is like that unless specified differently.

## GENERAL
+ tick -> t
+ tier
